# HIFI-barcode-SE400
The BGISEQ-500 platform has launched a new test sequencing kits capable of single-end 400 bp sequencing (SE400), which offers a simple and reliable way to achieve DNA barcodes efficiently. In this study, we explored the potential of the BGISEQ-500 SE400 sequencing in DNA barcode reference construction, meanwhile provided an updated HIFI-Barcode software package that can generate COI barcode assemblies using HTS reads of length >= 400 bp.

### Installation

#### System requirement and dependencies 
Operating system: HIFI-SE is designed to run on most platforms, including UNIX, Linux and MacOS/X. Microsoft Windows. We have tested on Linux and on MacOS/X, because these are the machines we develop on. HIFI-SE is written in python language, and a version 3.5 or higher is required.
#### Dependencies: 
- biopython version 1.5 or higher (required). Please check https://biopython.org/ and https://pypi.org/project/biopython/#description for more details on installation of biopython.
- Another python package - bold_identification is also required for getting complete function of HIFI-SE. See https://pypi.org/project/bold-identification/
- HIFI-SE supposed you have installed the VSEARCH on your device, and its path in your $PATH. See https://github.com/torognes/vsearch

#### Install

1. I only deploy my latest version on github, so you can clone this repository to your local computer. However, it would not solve package dependencies, thus you need to install biopython and bold_identification before using HIFI-SE software.<b>(NOTE: pip is a link from pip3)</b>

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/comery/HIFI-barcode-SE400.git
	pip install biopython
	pip install bold_identification  
	```
	
2. Installation by pip is recommended because it will solve package dependencies automatically, including biopython and bold_identification packages. 

	```pip install HIFI-SE``` 


### Usage (latest)

```shell
python3 HIFI-SE.py
```
or 

```shell
./HIFI-SE.py
```

```text
usage: HIFI-SE [-h] [-v]
               {all,filter,assign,assembly,polish,bold_identification} ...

Description

    An automatic pipeline for HIFI-SE400 project, including filtering
    raw reads, assigning reads to samples, assembly HIFI barcodes
    (COI sequences), polished assemblies, and do tax identification.

All related files could be found from here. The important files for tutorial are:

- <i>raw.fastq.gz</i>, raw output fastq file generated from BGISEQ-500 SE400 module.
- <i>indexed_primer.list</i>, tagged primer list


#### Run in "all"
Example:

```shell
python3 HIFI-SE.py all -outpre hifi -trim -e 5 -raw test.raw.fastq -index 5 -primer index_primer.list -mode 1 -cid 0.98 -oid 0.95 -seqs_lim 50000 -threads 4 -tp 2
